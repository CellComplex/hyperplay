Explore tilings on the hyperbolic plane

[**PLAY HERE!**](http://timhutton.github.io/hyperplay/)

This is work in progress. Currently it shows the {3,q} family of tilings, and intermediate forms. When you move the mouse left and right the construction process (reflection in the faces of the base polygon) stays the same but the curvature of the space itself changes. Positive curvature gives us hyperbolic tilings. Negative curvature gives us polyhedra. Zero curvature gives us plane tiling.

If you're keen to see more, download the html and change the value of N in init() to 4 or higher. 

Thanks to Adam P. Goucher for getting me started with hyperbolic tessellation! [Here's a blog post](http://cp4space.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/hyperbolic-minecraft/) he wrote about it.
