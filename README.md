Explore tilings on the hyperbolic plane

[**PLAY HERE!**](http://timhutton.github.io/hyperplay/)

This is work in progress. Currently it just shows a static rendering of the {4,5} tiling of the hyperbolic plane. If I ever get round to it it will allow you to move the circles and things to generate other tilings and other patterns.

Thanks to Adam P. Goucher for getting me started with hyperbolic tessellation! [Here's a blog post](http://cp4space.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/hyperbolic-minecraft/) he wrote about it.
